	<ul>
		<li> Academic Chair (Spring 2019, Fall 2019): In charge of organization of all Cornell-internal events.
		<br> I proposed and was the primary organizer of the inaugural iteration of <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem10393/research-night-sharing-new-findings">CS Research Night</a> which introduced 100+ undergrads to CS research at Cornell (and led to many undergrads becoming undergraduate researchers and REU participants). 
		<br> I also organized the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem10840/research-night-connecting-undergraduates-cs-research">second iteration</a> which further reached 150+ undergrads. 
		<br> I also was the primary organizer of the first <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem10436/welcome-cornell-days-computer-science">Computer Science Cornell Days</a> which introduced Cornell Computer Science to admitted high school students. We received feedback from multiple students that this was the best experience during their visit to Cornell.</li>
		<li> Research Chair (Fall 2018): In charge of organization of all research events.
		<br> I organized a semester-long reading group which focused on bridging paper-reading with survey-style content to appeal to and to be accessible to younger students.</li>
		<li> NLP/Deep Learning Reading Group Leader (Spring 2018): Ran a reading group bridging pre-deep learning NLP and post-deep learning NLP while building up fundamentals for students with minimal machine learning/linear algebra background. </li>
		<li> NLP/Machine Learning Reading Group Leader (Fall 2017): Ran a reading group focused on NLP papers published by Cornell NLP that had approachable ML content for younger students. </li>
