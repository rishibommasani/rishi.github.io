				<h1> Rishi Bommasani</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP group</a> and the <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford AI Laboratory</a>. 
				<br> In the summer and fall I will be working with <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a> and in the winter I will be working with both <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> and <a href="https://thashim.github.io/">Tatsu Hashimoto</a>.</p>

				<p> My graduate studies are funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11136/cs-graduate-students-receive-national-science-foundation-graduate"> [Press Release] </a> </p>

				<p> I graduated with a M.S. in Computer Science in 2020, B.A. in Computer Science in 2019, and a B.A. in Mathematics in 2019, all from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. 
				    <br> Throughout my time there, I was exceedingly fortunate to be advised by the amazing <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a>.
				    <br> In many ways, during my four years at Cornell, Cornell CS was my home. The department wrote this nice piece about my time at Cornell. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11229/profile-cornell-cs-ba-and-ms-graduate-rishi-bommasani"> [Profile] </a> <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11227/lillian-lee-and-tacl-cs-graduate-stanford-new-platform-data-privacy"> [Profile 2] </a> </p>
				
				<p> My research focuses on building and understanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a> systems in a scientifically principled and theoretically sound manner.
			            <br> Research Interests: Interpretability, Social Bias and Fairness, Information Theory, Algorithms, Privacy, Psycholinguistics, and Cognitive Science.</p>
