        		<h1> Rishi Bommasani</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm a M.S. student in the Computer Science department at Cornell University and I am part of the <a href="https://nlp.cornell.edu/">Cornell NLP</a> group. I also did my undergrad at Cornell and graduated <em> magna cum laude </em> with degrees in mathematics and computer science in Spring 2019.</p>
				
				<p> My research focuses on data understanding for NLP as a mechanism for inducing useful guarantees and improving downstream performance of (neural) models. In general, I am interested in injecting soundness into modern NLP systems without compromising performance.</p>
					
<p>I am extremely fortunate that <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a> has been my research adviser during my undergrad and now during my M.S. My thesis committee is Claire (chair) and <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/">Bobby Kleinberg</a>. </p>
			
			<p> I have spent two summers as a research intern in the <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/machine-learning/">DeepSpeech</a> group at Mozilla, advised by Dr. Kelly Davis. I also spent a summer at Cornell as a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517">NSF REU</a> researcher.</p>

			<p> During my academic career, <a href="https://rishibommasani.github.io/teaching">teaching</a> has been an integral part of my life. Similarly, I have found great joy in <a href="https://rishibommasani.github.io/service">serving</a> my department.
