				<h1> Rishi Bommasani</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP group</a> and the <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/">Stanford AI Laboratory</a>. 
				<br> I am blessed to be advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a>.
				<br> My graduate studies are currently funded by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about_grfp">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP)</a>. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11136/cs-graduate-students-receive-national-science-foundation-graduate"> [Press Release] </a> </p>

				<p> I graduated with a bachelors (Mathematics, Computer Science; 2019) and masters (Computer Science; 2020) from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. 
				<br> Throughout my time there, I was exceedingly fortunate to be advised by the incomparable <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a>.
				<br> I was very fortunate to learn from and collaborate with the <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/660710/2021/06/07/college-engineering-mourns-loss-faculty-member-arzoo-katiyar">late</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arzook99/home">Professor Arzoo Katiyar</a>, who I profoundly miss and am deeply grateful to. 
				<br> During my four years at Cornell, <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell CS</a> was my home. The department wrote this nice piece about my time at Cornell. <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11229/profile-cornell-cs-ba-and-ms-graduate-rishi-bommasani"> [Profile] </a> <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem11227/lillian-lee-and-tacl-cs-graduate-stanford-new-platform-data-privacy"> [Profile 2] </a> </p>
				
				<p> My research focuses on understanding AI systems and their social impact, as well as using NLP to further scientific inquiry. 
				<br> Primary Research Interests: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">Foundation Models</a>, Measurement and Evaluation, Model Analysis and Interpretability, Social Impact of AI
				<br> Secondary Research Interests: Computational Social Science, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Science, Algorithms and TCS, Privacy </p>
